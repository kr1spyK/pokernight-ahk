# pokernight-ahk
AutoHotKey v2 script for Poker Night at the Inventory.
Speed up gameplay and auto-call feature.
Intended for 800x600 windowed resolution.
When script started, continously skips dialogue so it should force the game to run in background.
Due to limitations of the game and AHK, this script cannot run completely in background. Only skip dialogue will.
Press \[Pause\] key to pause the click Call and Deal New Hand subroutine. Skip dialogue will still run.
Press \[F4\] to exit the script.

Planned features: image/text recognition for straight flush optimization (fold low probability hands)
