# fastplay/AFK script for Poker Night at the Inventory
Written for AutoHotKey v2+.
I made this to grind the Straight Flush achievement, but naturally all hands would appear with some modification.

Speed up gameplay; AFK feature intended for 800x600 windowed resolution.

When script started, continously skips dialogue so it should force the game to run in background.
Due to limitations of the game and AHK, this script cannot run completely in background. Only skip dialogue will.

Press \[Pause\] key to pause the autoplay subroutine. Skip dialogue will still run without interfering with your mouse cursor.

Press \[F4\] to exit the script.

Planned features: image/text recognition for straight flush optimization (fold low probability hands)
